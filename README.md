# Scalable Cloud Infrastructure for Web Application (AWS)

Role: Cloud / DevOps Intern Project  
Duration: Oct 2024 – Dec 2024  
Platform: AWS (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling)

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a cloud learning internship to understand how scalable and reliable infrastructure is designed on AWS.  
The objective was to create a basic but production-like cloud setup for a sample web application that can handle varying traffic while remaining secure and cost-aware.

The project focuses on infrastructure reliability, traffic handling, and automatic scaling using AWS core services.

## Tech Stack

- Compute: Amazon EC2  
- Storage: Amazon S3  
- Networking: Custom VPC with public and private subnets  
- Security: IAM roles and policies  
- Scalability: Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling  

## Architecture Overview

- Designed a multi-tier architecture using a custom VPC  
- Used public and private subnets for network isolation  
- Configured an Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution  
- Implemented Auto Scaling to adjust compute capacity automatically  
- Used S3 for static content and backups  

## Key Outcomes (Lab Based)

- Simulated high availability using Load Balancing and Auto Scaling  
- Automatic scaling from 1 to 3 EC2 instances during load testing  
- Reduced manual intervention through scaling policies  
- Applied cost-aware scaling to reduce resource usage during low traffic  

> All outcomes are based on AWS lab simulations and controlled test scenarios.

## What I Learned

- Basics of designing scalable and fault-tolerant cloud systems  
- How AWS services work together in real architectures  
- Importance of load balancing and auto scaling  
- Understanding trade-offs between performance, availability, and cost
